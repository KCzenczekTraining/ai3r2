"""
This script automates a conversation with an external API and OpenAI's GPT model.
It performs the following steps:
1. Sends an initial POST request to initiate the conversation.
2. Queries OpenAI's GPT model for an answer to the received question.
3. Sends the answer back to the API and retrieves a hidden phrase.

Ensure the `.env` file contains the required environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI.
- `ENDPOINT_s01e02`: Endpoint URL for the conversation API.
